### Parent Involvement
 * Parents can monitor study hours, as increased study time positively impacts performance.
* Encouraging consistent effort and providing support for study routines could help.  

### Access to Resources
Ensuring access to diverse study resources (including practice papers) can complement the study hours effectively.

 ### Tutoring Sessions
* Since previous performance is a strong predictor, students struggling early might benefit from personalized tutoring. 
* Early intervention through tutoring could help close gaps before they significantly impact future score

### School type
* Invest  in teachers training for all school type
* Encourage holistic development in both school types.
* Focus on infrastructure improvement in school.
